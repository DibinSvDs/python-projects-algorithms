## Python Projects and Algorithms
Here I will upload code of my Python Projects and some Algorithms.

Below you will see all the python projects I have uploaded in this repository.

## Guess the Number
This is a Number guessing created using Python.

Firstly you have to enter a number, If the number is less than the random number, You will get output, 'Please Enter a Higher Number', and If the number is higher than the random numbver, You will get output, 'Please Enter a Lower Number'

## Rock Paper Scissors
This is a Rock Paper Scissors Game made with Python, You can play this game whenever you are bored.

You will need only one module for this project, Random Module, This module will help you to generate a random number between 1 to 100.

## Linear Search
Linear search algorithm using Python.

Linear Search is easy to use, but, When the length of the array is bigger, Linear Search Takes more time, so, When the length of the array is small, Then you can use Linear search, other wise, use Binary Search for searching a number in an Array.

## Binary Search
Binary search algorithm using Python.

Binary Search algorithm is a faster searching algorithm. Binary Search takes less time than linear search. Now days, Binary Search is used most for searching a number in an array

## Guess the Number F
This is a number guessing game using Functions and Classes.

The code is changed but the game is not changed, In this game, If you entered an letter, like 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc., The game will still run, and that is the best thing about this project. (By the way, I'm a noob in this game)
